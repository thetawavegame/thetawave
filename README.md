## What is Thetawave?

Thetawave is a physics-based space shooter with procedurally generated levels, diverse foes, and distinct characters. As an open-source project, it invites collaboration and creativity from the community, allowing enthusiasts and developers to contribute to its evolution. This aspect of open-source development adds a unique dimension to Thetawave, as it grows and diversifies with inputs from its user base. Engaging in both gameplay and development, players and developers alike can experience the thrill of space combat while shaping the game's future.

**Special Mechanics:**

## Building and Playing Locally

While you can play [in the browser](https://thetawave.metalmancy.tech) (works best on Google Chrome...for now), you can
play offline in a few ways. The simplest way to play a native build of the game offline is to download the latest
[Github release](https://github.com/thetawavegame/thetawave/releases) for Windows or Linux. Then run the executable.

To run the game after compiling locally, do the following.

0. Clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/thetawavegame/thetawave.git`
0. Download our assets.

   One way is to download a recent Linux `.tar.gz` release, and extract the `assets/` directory in the tarball into your
   local `assets/` directory. We do so in the following Bash command. In Windows, just copy the files manually. Replace
   the link with that of a build from the [latest release](https://github.com/thetawavegame/thetawave/releases),
   especially if you are running off of the `main` branch.

   ```bash

   curl -Ls https://github.com/thetawavegame/thetawave/releases/download/v0.2.0/thetawave-0.2.0-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz  \
       | tar -xz -C assets/ --strip-components=2 --wildcards "*/assets/*"
   ```

   If when running the `main` branch you still have missing assets, it means that we are using assets that are not yet
   published in a release. In that case, you might checkout the latest tag. Find it by running `git tag` and then
   execute, for example, `git checkout v0.2.0`.

0. Compile/run using [Cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo) as follows.

   ```bash
   cargo run --release
   ```

0. Enable the install features you want. Our install features are as follows.

   - `cli` - Enables start up parameters on the built `thetawave` executable.
   - `storage` - Enables writing user stats to a local [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) database.
   - `arcade` - Enables arcade-specific features, namely through serial communication to a microcontroller.

   One can run using install features as follows.

   ```bash
   cargo run --release --features "storage,cli,arcade"
   ```
