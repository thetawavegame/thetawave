# Thetawave-arcade

This crate exposes Bevy plugins that implement features specific to the arcade cabinet build target/platform.


## Configuration

- `THETAWAVE_ARCADE_LIGHT_SERIAL_PORT_NAME` = The name of the serial port that controls the lights. We will probably
  automate detecting this later, but this is currently related to a port used by Arduino.
